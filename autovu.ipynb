      "Looking at the first result from Wikipedia, it says Jensen Huang has been the President and CEO since 1993, which is a long time. That gives some confidence that he's still in the role unless there's recent news of a change. The LinkedIn profile also mentions him as the co-founder and doesn't indicate any departure.\n",

      "The NVIDIA Newsroom explicitly states he's the Founder, President, and CEO, serving since 1993. That seems pretty official. Forbes corroborates this information too, noting that he's been CEO since the company started. \n",
      "\n",
      "There are some recent dates in the snippets as well. A YouTube video from January 27, 2025, talks about his vision for the future, which suggests he was active as CEO at least up until then. Another snippet from February 26, 2025, mentions him speaking at a news conference, which is very recent. Additionally, a Reddit post from August 28, 2024, confirms that he's been serving as CEO since the company started.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't see any information indicating that someone else has taken over as CEO. All sources consistently mention Jensen Huang in the role without any hints of a change. Given that multiple sources, including official ones like NVIDIA's Newsroom and recent news articles, confirm his position, it seems safe to conclude he's still the CEO.\n",

      "Okay, so I need to figure out who the current CEO of GlobalFoundries is. Let me go through the search results provided and see what information I can gather.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, looking at the snippets, some mention Dr. Thomas Caulfield as President & CEO, but others talk about a leadership transition where Tim Breen takes over as CEO. For example, one snippet from February 5, 2025, says that GlobalFoundries named COO Tim Breen as their next CEO, succeeding Thomas Caulfield. Another result from the same date mentions that Caulfield is moving to Executive Chairman, and Breen replaces him as CEO.\n",
      "\n",
      "There's also a Wikipedia snippet listing the CEOs, showing that Thomas Caulfield was CEO until 2025, and now it's Tim Breen starting in 2025. Additionally, a CNBC snippet from February 14, 2025, refers to Thomas Caulfield as the current CEO. Hmm, that seems conflicting because other sources from early February say he stepped down.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, maybe I need to check the dates more carefully. The CNBC interview is dated February 14, which is after the leadership change was announced on February 5 and 6. So it's possible that the CNBC snippet might have been published before the transition took effect or perhaps it's an error. Alternatively, maybe Thomas Caulfield was still acting as CEO during that time but had already announced his transition.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another point is that multiple sources from early February clearly state that Tim Breen has been named the new CEO, effective around April 28, 2025, according to one snippet where Caulfield becomes Executive Chairman then. So by now (assuming we're in 2025 after April), Tim Breen should be the current CEO.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think the key here is to determine the most recent and accurate information. Since multiple sources confirm that Tim Breen has taken over as CEO, especially with the February 5th announcements, it's likely he is the current CEO. The CNBC interview might have been a bit behind or perhaps referred to him in his previous role during the transition period.\n",
      "\n",
      "So putting it all together, despite some conflicting information, the majority of recent sources point to Tim Breen as the new CEO starting in 2025 after Thomas Caulfield stepped down.\n",
      "</think>\n",

      "The current CEO of GlobalFoundries is Tim Breen. He succeeded Dr. Thomas Caulfield in early 2025.\n",

      "Alright, let's figure out who the current CEO of 21st Century Fox is. I'm a bit confused because the search results have different information. \n",
      "\n",
      "First, I see that Lachlan Murdoch is the Executive Chair and CEO of Fox Corporation in some snippets. But wait, isn't Fox Corporation different from 21st Century Fox? I remember that Disney acquired most of 21st Century Fox, so maybe there's a spin-off or rebranding involved here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at another result, James Murdoch was the CEO of 21st Century Fox before, but he left. There's a snippet saying he became CEO starting July 1, 2015, but that might be outdated because it's from Jun 16, 2015. \n",
      "\n",
      "Another search result mentions that Lachlan Murdoch is the co-chairman of 21st Century Fox, along with his brother James. But now, in Sep 2023, he's the CEO of Fox Corporation. I think after Disney bought 21st Century Fox, the remaining part became Fox Corporation, so maybe Lachlan is leading that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but some results still refer to James as CEO of 21st Century Fox. Maybe there was a transition where James stepped down and Lachlan took over? Or perhaps they're both involved in different capacities.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm not entirely sure if 21st Century Fox still operates separately or if it's fully integrated into Disney now. If it's part of Disney, maybe the CEO position doesn't exist anymore. But some snippets suggest that 21st Century Fox is still operational with its own executives, like James Murdoch as CEO and Lachlan as Executive Chair.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm a bit torn because different sources give different names. The most recent date I see is Sep 2023 mentioning Lachlan at Fox Corporation, but another result from the same year says James is CEO of 21st Century Fox. Maybe they're both in leadership roles but at different entities under the larger organization.\n",
      "\n",
      "Considering all this, I think the safest answer is that James Murdoch was the last confirmed CEO before any potential changes, so maybe he's still in that role. But I'm not entirely certain because some info points to Lachlan as well.\n",

      "Looking at the first result, it's from Intel's Newsroom and says that Lip-Bu Tan was appointed as CEO in March 2025. He also serves on the board of directors. The date on this snippet is March 12, 2025, which is pretty recent.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second result is from Reuters, posted just 15 hours ago. It mentions Lip-Bu Tan as the new CEO and quotes him asking customers for honest feedback. This seems to confirm that he's the current CEO.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another result again states that Lip-Bu Tan was appointed in March 2025. The date here is also March 12, so it's consistent with the first source.\n",
      "\n",
      "There's a snippet from WSJ talking about Intel's new CEO needing a break from the past, and it's dated just 4 hours ago. This further solidifies that Lip-Bu Tan is indeed the current CEO.\n",
      "\n",
      "All the other results consistently mention Lip-Bu Tan as the new CEO, with recent dates like 12 hours or 15 hours ago. There's no conflicting information in any of the search results; they all point to him being appointed this year.\n",
      "\n",
      "So putting it all together, every source I'm looking at confirms that Lip-Bu Tan is the current CEO of Intel, and the information is up-to-date as of March 2025.\n",

The second result from LinkedIn also mentions he founded Nvidia in 1993, so that's consistent.\\n\\nLooking at the NVIDIA Newsroom snippet, it again states he's the Founder, President, and CEO since the company started. Forbes echoes this information as well, adding that he still owns a percentage of the company. \\n\\nThere are some YouTube videos mentioning him as the current CEO in 2025 and 2024. A news article from February 26, 2025, refers to him as the CEO during a conference. Another video from March 1, 2024, also interviews him as the CEO.\\n\\nThe Reddit snippet talks about his role as CEO since April 1993 when he co-founded Nvidia with others. All these sources consistently mention Jensen Huang as the CEO without any indication of a change.\\n\\nI don't see any conflicting information or mentions of someone else taking over as CEO. Every source, from different dates up to early 2025, confirms his position. So it's safe to conclude that he's still the current CEO.\""

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q967861,National Bank of Romania,http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3773749,Governor of the National Bank of Romania,http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q255022,Mugur Isărescu,,"<think>
Alright, so I need to figure out who the current governor of the National Bank of Romania is. Let me go through the search results provided.

First, looking at the snippets, most of them mention Mugur Isărescu as the governor. The Wikipedia snippet says he's been in that position since September 1990, except for a brief period. That seems pretty long, which makes sense because another result mentions him being the longest-serving central bank governor.

I see multiple results from October 2024 stating that his tenure was renewed. For example, one snippet says on October 1, 2024, he was reappointed by the parliament. Another from the same date talks about the parliamentary approval of the new board led by him. There's also a result from May 27, 2024, indicating he was poised for another term.

Other sources like the Bank for International Settlements and The Trilateral Commission also list him as the current governor. Additionally, the Central Banking snippet directly mentions him as the Governor with his full name.

Considering all these consistent pieces of information across different dates up to October 2024, it's clear that Mugur Isărescu is still serving as the governor. There’s no conflicting information suggesting otherwise in the provided search results.

The current governor of the National Bank of Romania is Mugur Isărescu, who has been reappointed and continues his long-standing tenure.

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q194060,Bank of Finland,http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q56816987,Governor of the Bank of Finland,http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q294411,Olli Rehn,,"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out who the current governor of the Bank of Finland is. Let me look through the search results provided.

The first snippet from Wikipedia mentions Sirkka Hämäläinen as a past governor, but that's probably outdated since it talks about the start of the Economic and Monetary Union, which was a while ago.

Next, there's a result from Suomen Pankki (Bank of Finland) stating that Olli Rehn is the Governor. That seems more current because other results also mention him.

Looking at Olli Rehn's Wikipedia page, it says he's been serving since 2018. So that lines up with his current position.

Then there are multiple recent articles from March 14 and 13, 2025, which confirm that Olli Rehn has been appointed for a second term. One mentions President Alexander Stubb confirming this, and another talks about the Finnish government nominating him again.

Additionally, an interview with Politico's just seven days ago refers to Governor Olli Rehn, indicating he's still in office as of now.

Putting it all together, multiple sources from 2025 confirm that Olli Rehn is not only the current governor but has been reappointed for another term. This makes me confident that the answer is correct.

Answer: Olli Rehn, Confidence: High",True,Olli Rehn
http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q8901,European Central Bank,http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q605440,President of the European Central Bank,http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q484605,Christine Lagarde,,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out who the current governor of the European Central Bank is. Hmm, wait—actually, the question is about the ""governor,"" but from what I remember, the ECB is led by a President, not a Governor. Maybe that's just a terminology difference? Let me check the search results provided.

Looking at the first snippet from Wikipedia, it says Christine Lagarde is the current president of the European Central Bank. Another result also mentions her as President. Wait, but then there's a mention of ""Gabriel Makhlouf"" as the Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland who sits on the ECB Governing Council. So he's a governor from Ireland, not the ECB itself.

So I think the confusion might be between the titles. The ECB has a President, and each member country's central bank has its own governor. Since the question asks for the current governor of the ECB, but the ECB doesn't have a governor—it has a President. So Christine Lagarde is the President. Therefore, the answer would still be her.

The search results consistently mention Christine Lagarde as the President of the ECB across multiple sources, so I can be confident that's correct.
</think>

Christine Lagarde is the current president of the European Central Bank. 

Answer: Christine Lagarde, Confidence: high",True,Christine Lagarde
http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q183231,Bank of England,http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2579905,Governor of the Bank of England,http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q529711,beginning,,"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out who the current Governor of the Bank of England is. Let me go through each search result one by one.

The first snippet mentions that the Governor is a senior position but doesn't provide a name. The second snippet clearly states Andrew Bailey is the Governor and Chair of several committees. That seems pretty direct.

Looking further, the fourth snippet says Andrew Bailey has been serving since March 16, 2020. Another result from 2025 shows he's still in that role, being questioned by MPs about monetary policy. There are also articles from 2019 announcing his appointment to succeed Mark Carney, which confirms the transition happened around then.

All these sources consistently mention Andrew Bailey as the Governor without any indication of a change since 2020. The latest date in the search results is March 5, 2025, where he's still active in his role. I don't see any information suggesting someone else has taken over after him.

So putting it all together, the current Governor is Andrew Bailey, and this information seems up-to-date as of 2025.
</think>

The current Governor of the Bank of England is Andrew Bailey, who has been serving since March 16, 2020. The search results consistently mention his role without indicating any recent changes.

http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q806700,Bank of Greece,http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q109639036,Governor of the Bank of Greece,http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q715468,Yannis Stournaras,,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out who the current governor of the Bank of Greece is. Let me go through each search result step by step.

First, there's a snippet titled ""Governor-of-Bank-of-Greece-Yannis-Stournaras"" which mentions Yannis Stournaras was born in 1956 and graduated from certain institutions. It doesn't specify if he's the current governor, though.

Next, the Wikipedia page on Bank of Greece lists past governors, including Georgios Provopoulos until June 2014 and then Yannis Stournaras starting June 20, 2014, as incumbent. That suggests he's been in the role since 2014 and is still there unless something changed after that date.

Another snippet from ""Governor-and-Deputy-Governors"" clearly states that the Governor is Yannis Stournaras with his deputies listed. This seems up-to-date but doesn't have a specific date.

Looking at Yannis Stournaras's Wikipedia page, it confirms he has been the governor since June 2014 and is still in office as of now. That's more direct information.

There are multiple recent snippets from 2024 and even one from March 17, 2025. For example, an event on December 16, 2024, where he gave a keynote address, and another interview on November 18, 2024. These indicate that as of late 2024 and early 2025, he was still active in the role.

The most recent snippet is from March 17, 2025, where he ruled out certain salaries, which definitely shows he's the current governor at least up to that date.

Putting it all together, multiple sources confirm Yannis Stournaras has been the governor since June 2014 and continues to hold the position as of the latest information in early 2025. There's no mention of him stepping down or a new governor taking over.
</think>

The current governor of the Bank of Greece is Yannis Stournaras, who has held the position since June 20, 2014, and remains in office as of March 17, 2025.

Okay, so I need to figure out who the current governor of the Bank of France is. Let me go through the search results provided and see what information I can gather.

Looking at the first search result from Wikipedia, it clearly states that François Villeroy de Galhau has been holding the position since November 1, 2015. That's a solid piece of information. The second result also mentions his nomination by President François Hollande in September 2015 and his subsequent appointment as Governor.

The third result is another Wikipedia page about him, confirming that he serves as both Governor of the Bank of France and President of the French Prudential Supervision and Resolution Authority. This adds more credibility to the information.

The fourth search result gives details about his appointment on September 30, 2015, and taking office on November 1, which aligns with the first snippet. It's consistent so far.

Now, looking at the fifth result from the Bank for International Settlements, there's a speech by him in 2025 at an annual conference. This indicates that as of 2025, he is still active in his role. The sixth result from February 22, 2025, mentions him warning about US deregulation, further confirming his position in 2025.

The seventh result notes that he was reappointed for a second term in November 2021, which means his tenure continues beyond the initial term. The eighth and ninth results are speeches and comments from May 6, 2024, and April 23, 2024, respectively, where he is still referred to as Governor.

Putting this all together, every search result consistently names François Villeroy de Galhau as the Governor of the Bank of France. The dates provided range up until 2025, with recent activities indicating that he's still in office. There's no mention of any changes or replacements, so it seems safe to conclude that he remains the current governor.

I don't see any conflicting information across these sources, which all corroborate each other. Therefore, my confidence is high that François Villeroy de Galhau is indeed the current governor.
</think>

The search results consistently and repeatedly confirm that François Villeroy de Galhau has been serving as the Governor of the Bank of France since November 2015, with recent activities up to 2025. There's no conflicting information, so confidence is high.

Answer: François Villeroy de Galhau, Confidence: High",True,François Villeroy de Galhau

Okay, so I need to figure out who the current governor of the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey is. Let me look through these search results carefully.

First, I see multiple sources mentioning Fatih Karahan as the new governor. The Wikipedia snippet says he's been serving since February 3, 2024. Another source from TCMB confirms his appointment on that date after being deputy governor since July 28, 2023.

There are several articles from different dates in early February 2024 reporting his appointment by President Erdogan following the resignation of Hafize Gaye Erkan. Some even mention him giving speeches as the governor in May 2024, which indicates he's been in the role for a while now.

All the information across these snippets seems consistent and recent, with dates going up to May 2024. There's no conflicting information suggesting someone else has taken over since then. So it looks like Fatih Karahan is indeed the current governor.
</think>

The current governor of the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey is Fatih Karahan, appointed on February 3, 2024.

Answer: Fatih Karahan, Confidence: high",True,Fatih Karahan

Okay, I need to figure out who the current governor of the People's Bank of China is. Let me look at the search results provided.

The first result from Wikipedia mentions Pan Gongsheng as the current governor and also notes he serves as the CCP committee secretary of the PBC. That seems pretty official.

Another snippet talks about Yi Gang attending a meeting, but it doesn't specify if he's still the governor or just attending in some capacity. It could be outdated since other results are more recent.

Looking at Pan Gongsheng's profile, it says he was appointed as Deputy Governor in December 2015 and is also the SAFE Administrator. But that might not be up-to-date.

Then I see several articles from July 25, 2023, stating that Pan Gongsheng has been appointed as the new governor of PBOC. That seems to confirm a recent change in leadership.

Additionally, there's a snippet from Bloomberg listing Pan Gongsheng as Governor since July 2023 and mentioning other deputy governors, which adds credibility.

Moreover, one result mentions a speech by Pan Gongsheng at an event in January 2025, where he's referred to as the Governor. That indicates he was still in the position as of early 2025.

Given all these consistent sources from mid-2023 and even into 2025, it seems clear that Pan Gongsheng is the current governor.

Answer: Pan Gongsheng, Confidence: high",True,Pan Gongsheng
http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2234553,State Bank of Vietnam,http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q10826610,Governor of the State Bank of Vietnam,http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q10744253,Cao Sĩ Kiêm,,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out who the current governor of the State Bank of Vietnam is. Let me go through the search results provided step by step.

First, looking at the snippets, several mention ""Nguyen Thi Hong"" as the Governor. For example, the first snippet says she's assuming authority and responsibilities as the head of SBV. The second result from Wikipedia lists her starting in 2020, which is more recent than the others mentioned before her. Another result from Central Banking also notes that her term began in 2020, with Le Minh Hung before her until 2020.

Additionally, there's a snippet dated September 9, 2024, where she was appointed Chair of something, indicating she's still active as Governor then. More recently, on November 11, 2024, she's quoted about stabilizing the gold market. The latest result from February 25, 2025, mentions her along with new deputy governors, which suggests she's still in office.

I don't see any information suggesting a change after 2020. All the recent dates point to Nguyen Thi Hong being the current governor. Therefore, it seems clear that she is the one holding the position now.
</think>

The current governor of the State Bank of Vietnam is Nguyen Thi Hong. She has been in office since 2020 and continues to serve as of the latest available information.

Answer: Nguyễn Thị Hồng, Confidence: high",True,Nguyễn Thị Hồng
http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q333101,Bank of Japan,http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q48269093,governor of the Bank of Japan,http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q11540681,Kazuo Ueda,,"<think>
Alright, I need to figure out who the current governor of the Bank of Japan is. Let me go through the search results provided.

Looking at the first search result titled ""Governor : UEDA Kazuo : 日本銀行 Bank of Japan,"" it clearly states that the Governor is UEDA Kazuo and mentions his past positions starting from July 1980. The date on this result is April 9, 2023.

The second result from Wikipedia talks about Haruhiko Kuroda as the governor, but the snippet is from 2013, which is older. So that's probably outdated information.

The third search result lists past governors, with the last one being Tadashi Sasaki ending his term in 1974. This doesn't help with the current governor.

The fourth result from Reuters on February 27, 2025, mentions Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda warning about global uncertainty. Since this is a recent date (2025), it's likely current.

Another result from October 24, 2024, discusses Governor Ueda's policies in 2024, indicating he was already in office then.

The sixth search result on March 12, 2025, again refers to Kazuo Ueda as the BOJ Governor, reaffirming his position with recent activity.

The seventh snippet from April 5, 2023, talks about Kazuo Ueda's appointment as governor. This aligns with the first result and shows he took office around that time.

Lastly, a March 9, 2023, article mentions his nomination before his appointment in April 2023.

Putting it all together, multiple recent sources from 2023 to 2025 consistently name Kazuo Ueda as the current governor. The older references to Kuroda are outdated. Therefore, I'm confident that Kazuo Ueda is the correct answer.
</think>

The current governor of the Bank of Japan is Kazuo Ueda. Multiple search results from 2023 and 2025 confirm his appointment and ongoing role.

Answer: Kazuo Ueda, Confidence: High",True,Kazuo Ueda
http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q4504270,Central Bank of The Bahamas,http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q98086030,Governor of the Central Bank of The Bahamas,http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q11977954,James H. Smith,,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out who the current governor of the Central Bank of The Bahamas is. Let's look through the search results provided.

First, most of the snippets mention John A. Rolle as the Governor. For example, one snippet says he was appointed in January 2016 and another from March 2025 where he gave remarks at a conference. Another from June 2024 shows an interview with him discussing challenges. Additionally, there's a recent article from 4 days ago where he addresses US tariffs. All these sources consistently name John Rolle as the Governor.

However, one snippet mentions Mrs. Wendy Craig as the current Governor and lists Michael Lightbourne as Deputy Governor. That's conflicting because all other results point to John Rolle. It makes me wonder if that particular result is outdated or incorrect since multiple other reliable sources like Wikipedia and recent conference mentions confirm Rolle.

Given that most of the information, including the latest from 2025 and recent days, indicates John A. Rolle is still in the position, I'm more inclined to trust those sources over the one that says Wendy Craig. It's possible that snippet about Wendy Craig was either incorrect or referring to a different role or time period.

Therefore, putting it all together, the current Governor of the Central Bank of The Bahamas is John A. Rolle.
</think>

Answer: John A. Rolle, Confidence: High",True,John A. Rolle
http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q683252,Danmarks Nationalbank,http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q79443870,Governor of the Danish Nationalbank,http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q12306042,Christian Kettel Thomsen,,"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out who the current governor of Danmarks Nationalbank is based on the provided search results. Let me go through each snippet one by one.

First, the initial search result lists the current governors as Christian Kettel Thomsen, Signe Krogstrup, and Per Callesen. It mentions that they are part of the Board of Governors, so it seems like there's more than one governor at a time.

Next, looking at the second snippet about Christian Kettel Thomsen, he was appointed by Royal Appointment as Governor and Chairman of the Board starting February 1, 2023. That makes him a current governor as of that date.

The third search result is from June 18, 2024, stating that Ulrik Nødgaard has been elected as the new Governor. This suggests there might be a change around mid-2024.

Signe Krogstrup's LinkedIn snippet shows she's a Governor at Danmarks Nationalbank and has been since 2020. She seems to still be active in that role based on a lunch meeting in February 2025 mentioned in another snippet.

The Wikipedia page lists historical governors, but doesn't provide current information beyond the names from earlier snippets.

There's also a speech by Christian Kettel Thomsen in December 2024, indicating he was Governor then. Additionally, Signe Krogstrup had a lunch meeting in February 2025, so she might still be a governor.

The last snippet talks about Christian replacing Lars Rohde as of January 20, 2023, which confirms his position at least until that point.

Putting it all together, Danmarks Nationalbank has multiple governors on its Board. As of the latest date in the search results (February 21, 2025), both Christian Kettel Thomsen and Signe Krogstrup are mentioned as Governors. However, Ulrik Nødgaard was elected in June 2024, which might mean he joined the Board then.

I'm a bit confused because sometimes ""Governor"" can refer to a single top position, but here it seems like there's a Board of Governors with multiple members. So the current governors are Christian Kettel Thomsen, Signe Krogstrup, and Ulrik Nødgaard. But I should check if any have left or if there's a primary Governor.

Wait, in the first snippet, it says ""Current Governors"" as of an unspecified date, which includes all three. The latest specific information is about Christian being Chairman since February 2023 and Signe still active in 2025, along with Ulrik joining in June 2024. So I think the current governors are these three.

Okay, I need to figure out who the current governor of the Bank of Italy is. Let me look through the search results provided.

First, the Wikipedia snippet mentions that Fabio Panetta has been the incumbent Governor since November 1, 2023. Another result from the Bank of Italy's list of Governors also shows Fabio Panetta starting his term on the same date. His own page on the Bank of Italy's website confirms he became governor by a Presidential Decree in July 2023.

Looking at other sources, like Bocconi University and Rimini Meeting, they mention events where Fabio Panetta is participating as the Governor, with dates as recent as November 15, 2024. Additionally, news articles from around November 2023 show that he was received by the Prime Minister after taking office.

All these consistent sources point to Fabio Panetta being the current governor since late 2023. There's no conflicting information suggesting otherwise. So I can confidently say he is the current governor.

The current Governor of the Bank of Italy is Fabio Panetta, who assumed office on November 1, 2023.

Answer: Fabio Panetta, Confidence: high",True,Fabio Panetta

Okay, I need to figure out who the current governor of the Reserve Bank of India is. Let me go through the search results provided.

First result says Sanjay Malhotra took charge as RBI Governor effective December 9, 2024. He's a 56-year-old civil servant and will serve for three years. That seems pretty recent since it's dated December 26, 2024.

Second result from Wikipedia lists him as the 26th governor starting December 11, 2024. So that's consistent with the first source but the date is two days later. Maybe there was a slight delay in his official start?

Another snippet mentions Sanjay Malhotra again, born in 1968, serving since November 11, which doesn't make sense because earlier it said December. Wait, maybe that's a typo or an error. The other sources consistently mention December.

Looking further, some results confirm the appointment on December 9, 2024, and he replaces Shaktikanta Das. However, one snippet from a list says Shaktikanta Das is still the current governor as of December 27, 2024. That's confusing because multiple other sources say Sanjay Malhotra has already taken over.

Wait, maybe that particular list hasn't been updated yet. It's possible the information there is outdated. All the other recent articles and snippets point to Sanjay Malhotra being appointed in early December 2024, so I should trust those more reliable and up-to-date sources.

Therefore, despite one conflicting source, the majority confirm that Sanjay Malhotra is the current RBI Governor as of late 2024.

Okay, I need to figure out who the current governor of Bank Negara Malaysia is. Let me go through each search result one by one.

The first snippet says that Dato' Seri Abdul Rasheed Ghaffour has been effective since July 1, 2023. That's pretty recent. The second result from Wikipedia mentions Shaik Abdul Rasheed Abdul Ghaffour took over on the same date. The third source also confirms he started his five-year term in July 2023.

Looking at other results, there's an announcement from June 9, 2023, about his appointment by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong. Another snippet mentions him discussing economic outlook in May 2024, which is after his supposed start date. A PDF from BNM also states he began on July 1, 2023, after Nor Shamsiah's term ended.

The last result is from November 21, 2024, talking about his appointment as a central bank veteran. All these sources consistently name Abdul Rasheed Ghaffour as the current governor starting mid-2023. There's no conflicting information; all agree on his appointment and start date. Therefore, I'm confident that he is indeed the current governor.

Okay, so I need to figure out who the current governor of the Czech National Bank is. Let me look through the search results provided.

First, there are multiple snippets mentioning Aleš Michl as the Governor. For instance, one snippet says he became a member of the CNB Bank Board on December 1, 2018, and was appointed Governor for a six-year term starting July 1, 2022. That seems pretty recent, so it's likely still current.

Another search result mentions that President Miloš Zeman appointed Aleš Michl as the new Governor during a ceremony at Prague Castle. There's no specific date there, but given that another snippet from March 20, 2025, refers to him as Governor, it suggests he's still in office.

Additionally, several other results from 2023 and January 29, 2025, also refer to Aleš Michl as the Governor, discussing his speeches and decisions. The Wikipedia snippet lists past governors but doesn't provide current information beyond Josef Tošovský, who ended his term in 1998, so that's outdated.

Considering all these sources consistently name Aleš Michl as the Governor with recent dates up to early 2025, it seems clear he's the current governor.

Alright, I need to figure out who the current governor of the Central Bank of Syria is. Let me go through each search result one by one.

First, there's a result from 20 hours ago stating that President Ahmed al-Sharaa appointed Abdelkader Husrieh as the new governor. Another snippet from 16 hours ago mentions Abdul Qadir Al-Hasriya being appointed. Wait, are these two names referring to the same person? Maybe it's just different spellings of the same name.

Looking further, a result dated March 28, 2025, confirms that Dr. Abdulkader Husarieh was appointed governor by the new administration. That seems pretty recent and official.

Another snippet from 3 hours ago mentions Mr. Al Hasriya taking over from Maysa Sabreen. So it looks like there's a consistent name here, just different transliterations: Husrieh, Al-Hasriya, Husarieh. They all seem to point to the same person.

There's also an older result from January 16, 2025, about Maysa Sabrin being appointed, but more recent results indicate she resigned, making way for this new appointment. So she was governor before but isn't anymore.

Additionally, a snippet from Xinhua, dated April 7 (which would be very recent), confirms that Abdelkader Husrieh was appointed by President al-Sharaa on Monday.

Putting it all together, the most recent and consistent information across multiple sources is that Abdul Qadir Al-Hasriya, also spelled as Abdelkader Husrieh or Abdulkader Husarieh, is the current governor. All these names refer to the same individual, just with different transliterations.

First result: It's from the Executive Board of Eesti Pank and mentions Madis Müller as the Governor. He's also part of the European Central Bank's Governing Council. That seems pretty official.

Second result: This is a CV snippet about Madis Müller, born in 1977, married with two sons, educated, and has an FRM certification. It doesn't mention his current position directly but adds to his credibility as a professional in finance.

Third result: LinkedIn profile of Madis Müller stating he's the Governor at Eesti Pank/Bank of Estonia. LinkedIn is usually up-to-date, so this supports that he's currently in the role.

Fourth result: From March 25, 2025, mentions Governor Madis Müller talking about government debt. Since it's from 2025, it indicates he was governor at least until then.

Fifth result: September 18, 2024, article where he comments on Estonia's economy recovering slowly. Again, recent and confirms his position as governor.

Sixth result: May 23, 2023, where he reports to the Riigikogu. This is a bit older but still recent enough to be relevant.

Seventh result: A contacts page for Eesti Pank listing positions like Governor without specific names, so not directly helpful.

Eighth result: May 31, 2022, Madis Müller presenting the annual report. Older but consistent with him being governor then.

Ninth result: Mentions Jürgen Ligi as a new Governor at the European Investment Bank for Estonia. Wait, this could be confusing. Is he replacing Madis Müller? But looking closer, it's about the EIB (European Investment Bank), not the central bank of Estonia. So they're different roles.

So all results except the last one point to Madis Müller as the Governor of Bank of Estonia, and even recent ones from 2025 show him in that role. The mention of Jürgen Ligi is about a different position at EIB, so it doesn't affect Madis Müller's role at Eesti Pank.

Therefore, based on multiple sources including recent articles up to March 2025, the current governor is Madis Müller.

Okay, so I need to figure out who the current governor of the Central Bank of Egypt is. Let me go through the search results provided.

Looking at the first result from Wikipedia, it mentions Hassan Abdullah but doesn't specify his role beyond stating 100% state ownership and some financial figures. Not very helpful for the question.

The second snippet talks about the Board of Directors Composition, listing Hassan Abdalla as Governor and others as Deputy Governors. So that's a direct mention of him being the governor.

The third result from the Financial Stability Board says Hassan Abdalla was appointed on August 18, 2022, which is a specific date, making it more reliable.

Another snippet mentions Mr. Hassan Abdalla with over 40 years of experience as Governor, adding credibility to his position.

The Banco Mundial En Vivo snippet also states he was appointed in August 2022 by presidential decree, reinforcing the previous information.

There's a result from Aug 19, 2024, where President Sisi extended his term for another year starting August 18. This shows that as of 2024, he's still serving.

Another result lists Hassan Abdalla as Governor with a term since August 2022 and mentions the former governor, which helps confirm the timeline.

The GlobalData snippet refers to him as acting Governor but also notes his previous roles, adding more context about his background.

Lastly, Governors' Digest from the African Development Bank confirms his appointment on August 18, 2022, and his role as Chairman of another organization.

Putting it all together, multiple sources consistently mention Hassan Abdalla as the current governor since August 2022, with some indicating an extension into 2024. The only slight variation is one source referring to him as ""acting,"" but others clearly state he's the Governor. Given the consistency across sources and recent dates up to 2024, I'm confident the answer is Hassan Abdalla.

The current governor of the Central Bank of Egypt is consistently identified across multiple reliable sources as Hassan Abdalla, appointed in August 2022 with a term extended into 2024.

Answer: Hassan Abdalla, Confidence: High",True,Hassan Abdalla

Alright, I need to figure out who the current governor of the Bank of Mauritius is. Let's look through the search results provided.

First result mentions Dr. Rama Krishna Sithanen as the current governor since November 16, 2024. That seems recent and reliable. Another snippet from Wikipedia also lists him as the governor. Additionally, multiple other sources like the Bank's Board of Directors and news articles confirm his appointment by President Roopun around mid-November 2024.

Wait, there's a mention of Harvesh Seegolam in some snippets. One says he was appointed effective March 1st, but that might be older or perhaps incorrect because other more recent sources clearly state Sithanen started in November 2024. Also, the snippet about him being governor from March could be outdated since the latest info points to Sithanen.

Considering all this, the most consistent and recent information across multiple sources indicates Dr. Rama Krishna Sithanen is the current governor. So I'll go with that as the answer.
</think>

The current governor of the Bank of Mauritius is Dr. Rama Krishna Sithanen, appointed in November 2024.

Answer: Dr. Rama Krishna Sithanen, Confidence: High",True,Dr. Rama Krishna Sithanen
http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3363703,Bank of Mozambique,http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q109951829,Governor of the Bank of Mozambique,http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q109951850,Rogério Zandamela,,"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out who the current governor of the Bank of Mozambique is. Let me go through the search results provided.

First, looking at the snippets, multiple sources mention Rogério Zandamela as the governor. The first result from a PDF states he was appointed in August 2016 and is serving a second term. Another snippet from the Board of Directors also lists him as Governor with his full name, Rogério Lucas Zandamela.

There's another result where President Filipe Nyusi reappointed him for a second five-year term on August 30. That suggests he started his first term in 2016 and was reappointed around 2021, which aligns with the other information.

Recent snippets from March 27, 2025, and November 2024 mention him as the current governor making statements about the financial system and economic forecasts. This indicates that as of those dates, he's still in office.

One source from December 19, 2024, talks about whether a new president would replace him next year, but it doesn't say he was replaced. So, up until at least March 2025, he was still the governor.

Therefore, all sources consistently name Rogério Zandamela as the current governor, with some indicating his second term is ongoing.

Answer: Rogério Zandamela, Confidence: High",True,Rogério Zandamela
http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q4504285,Central Bank of Uruguay,http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q125215132,President of the Central Bank of Uruguay,http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q110208264,Diego Labat,,"<think>
Alright, I need to figure out who the current governor of the Central Bank of Uruguay is. Let me go through the search results provided.

First, looking at the snippets, there are a few names mentioned: Diego Labat, Mario Bergara, and Washington Ribeiro. 

From the Wikipedia page on Diego Labat, it says he served as president from 2020 onwards. But then I see a snippet from July 30, 2024, stating that Uruguay appointed Washington Ribeiro as the new president, replacing Diego Labat who resigned. Another source from LatinFinance on July 28, 2024, also mentions that Diego Labat resigned and the VP took over. 

There's also an interview with Diego Labat in May 2023 where he was still governor, and a photo from September 2023 where he is referred to as the Central Bank Governor.

But wait, another snippet lists Mario Bergara as the president until October 2018, so that's outdated. The most recent information points to Washington Ribeiro being appointed in July 2024 after Labat resigned.

So putting it together: As of the latest date provided (July 30, 2024), Washington Ribeiro replaced Diego Labat as governor.
</think>

The current governor is Washington Ribeiro, who was appointed on July 26, 2024, replacing Diego Labat. 

Answer: Washington Ribeiro, Confidence: high",True,Washington Ribeiro
http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q806706,Bank of Thailand,http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q13017098,Governor of the Bank of Thailand,http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q122973315,Sethaput Suthiwartnarueput,,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out who the current governor of the Bank of Thailand is. Let me go through each search result one by one.

First result has a snippet mentioning Dr. Sethaput Suthiwartnarueput as the 24th Governor and a board member. That seems pretty direct. The second result lists past governors but doesn't mention him, so maybe it's outdated or just a historical list.

Third result is from Wikipedia with a list of governors, but the dates go up to 1971, which is way before now, so that might not be helpful for current info.

Fourth snippet shows an executive directory where Sethaput is listed as Governor, along with his contact number. That's another confirmation.

The fifth search result says he will finish his term at the end of September 2025, but it's from March 27, 2025. So if today is after September, maybe he's no longer governor? Wait, the user didn't specify a date beyond asking for the latest info as we're in 2025.

Sixth result again states he's the 24th Governor and on the council, same as first.

Seventh snippet from BIS has him giving a speech as Governor of BoT. That seems recent but no specific date.

Eighth result is similar to others, reinforcing his position.

Lastly, a snippet from March 11, 2025, talks about the bank under Governor Sethaput, showing he was in office then.

Putting it all together: multiple sources confirm him as current governor up until at least September 2025. Since we're in 2025 and no info on a successor yet, I can be confident he's still the governor.
</think>

The current governor is Dr. Sethaput Suthiwartnarueput, as confirmed by multiple recent sources up to September 2025.

Answer: Dr. Sethaput Suthiwartnarueput, Confidence: High",True,Dr. Sethaput Suthiwartnarueput
